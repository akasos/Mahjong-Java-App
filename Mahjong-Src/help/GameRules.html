<h1 style="font-size: 18px">Welcome to MahJong Solitaire</h1>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;">Here is how you play.</h3>
<p style="font-size: 14px">The goal is to remove every tile by matching them in pairs.
    You can only remove tiles 2 at a time if they are <u>exposed</u>.
    A tile is considered exposed if it can be moved left <u>or</u> right without disturbing other tiles, including those on top of it.
    The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles.
    The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed paris remaining.</p>
