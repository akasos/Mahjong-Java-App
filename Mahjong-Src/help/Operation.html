<h1 style="font-size: 18px">Welcome to my game.</h1>
<h3 style="font-size: 16px;"> A quick break down how this program works.</h3>
<p style="font-size: 14px">When you first run the program you start out with the tiles arranged, stacked and ready to play.
    In the upper right corner is the current 'Game Number'. You can enter this number in at a later date and play the exact same game if wanting to.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px"> If you click on the menus in the left corner screen you will see a list of options you can choose from.
    You can 'Start a new Game', 'Reset a game' and even 'Undo moves within a game'. You also have the option of
    turning 'on' and 'off' the game sound.

<p style="font-size: 14px">Hope you enjoy :)</p>
